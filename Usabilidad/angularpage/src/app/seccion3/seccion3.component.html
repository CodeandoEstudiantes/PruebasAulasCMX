          <h5>SPEED & PERFORMANCE</h5> 
          Achieve the maximum speed possible on the Web Platform today, and take it further, via Web Workers and server-side rendering.
          
          Angular puts you in control over scalability. Meet huge data requirements by building data models on RxJS, Immutable.js or another push-model.
